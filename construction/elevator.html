<h1> Built to Spec: The Granular Side of Construction</h1>
<p> We don't believe in dumbing things down; we dive straight into the technical details for those who truly want to understand how things are built.</p>
<h2> The Detailer | Elevator Hoistway Access and Operational Logic</h2>
<h3> Elevator Drop Key</h3>
    <p>A drop key is primarily used to open the elevator hoistway door (the landing door/outer door) from the hallway. It' s a tool to manually disengage the hoistway door locking mechanism to access the shaft or the elevator car. It is inserted into a small hall on the hoistway door to trigger the unlocking lever allowing door to be opened even if the car is not present. Once the shank of the key passes through the door, a hinged "bit" or "wing" at the end drops into a horizontal position due to gravity. This allows the operator to rotate the key and engage the mechanical release arm on the interior side of the hoistway door. Without that gravitational "drop," you wouldn't be able to catch the release mechanism from the outside.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Insert the key into the hole.</li>
    <li>Wait for the wing to drop.</li>
    <li>Rotate to release the latch.</li>
</ol>
    <h4> When is it needed?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong> Accessing the car from the top:</strong>To perform an inspection or move the car in Inspection Mode, a technician must use the drop key to open the landing door while the car is positioned below the floor level. This allows them to safely step onto the canopy.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency Extraction:</strong>If the elevator becomes "lost" or safeties are tripped between floors, the drop key is the only way to manually retract the door interlock to get personnel out</li>
        <li><strong> Pit Acess:</strong>Pit Access: For work involving the governor tension sheave, buffers, or hydraulic jacks, the drop key is used at the lowest landing to enter the pit safely.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Operational Overrides</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong> Independent Service (ISC):</strong>The elevator no longer "talks" to the hall call buttons.  The doors remain open at the landing until a constant-pressure floor button is pushed. For example, if you’re moving a pallet of drywall or a specialized crew, you don't want the car stopping at every floor because a sub-contractor on Level 4 accidentally hit the hall button.</li>
    <li><strong> Inspection (INS):</strong> Inspection mode renders the Door Open/Close buttons and all Car Calls useless.  Movement is only possible via constant pressure "Up" or "Down" buttons on the car top or in the pit.. If you let go, the brake drops immediately. The controller limits the motor to a fraction of its rated velocity (typically 150 fpm or less) to prevent the technician from being "pinched" by the counterweights or overhead beams before they can react.</li>
    <li><strong> Fire Service Phase I:</strong> Phase I (Recall): Triggered by the smoke heads or the "Fire" key-switch in the lobby. The car ignores all commands and returns to the primary egress floor.</li>
    <li><strong> Fire Service zPhase II:</strong> Once recalled, a firefighter uses a specialized key inside the car. In this mode, the elevator is entirely manual. Unlike "Normal" mode, the doors will not open automatically when the car reaches a floor. The operator must hold the "Door Open" button until the doors are fully retracted. If they release the button halfway, the doors slam shut—a safety feature to check for fire/heat on the other side. </li>
</ul>
