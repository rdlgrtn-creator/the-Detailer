<h1>the detailer | Precious Metals: Futures vs. ETFs</h1>

<p>Understanding the difference between Notional Value and out-of-pocket cost is the key to trading silver and gold.</p>

<u>Silver Futures (/SI)</u>
<p>One standard Silver Futures contract represents 5,000 troy ounces. At a spot price of $85.91, the math looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
    5,000 t oz x $85.91 = $429,550 Notional Value
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>Tick Value</strong> (the smallest move) is $25. This means a $1.00 move in silver results in a $5,000 change in your account value.</p>

<u>The SLV Alternative</u>
<p>The Silver ETF (SLV) is more manageable. While one futures contract controls $429,550 of silver, one SLV option contract controls 100 shares:</p>

<blockquote>
    $75.44 (Share Price) x 100 = $7,544 Notional Value
</blockquote>

<u>Gold Futures (/GC)</u>
<p>One gold contract controls 100 troy ounces. With gold at $4,887.07, the notional value is $488,707. Traders often use <strong>Margin</strong> (about $27,000) to control this, creating massive leverage.</p>

<u>The Gold-Silver Ratio (GSR)</u>
<p>This metric tells us which metal is "cheaper" relatively. You divide the price of gold by the price of silver:</p>

<blockquote>
    $4,887.07 / $85.91 = 56.8
</blockquote>

<p>It currently takes about 57 ounces of silver to buy 1 ounce of gold.</p>
