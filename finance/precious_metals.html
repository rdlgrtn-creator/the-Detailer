<h1>the detailer | Precious Metals: Futures vs. ETFs</h1>

<p>A deep dive into the notional value and leverage of Silver and Gold markets as of February 2026.</p>

<u>Silver: Futures (/SI) vs. SLV</u>
<p>One standard Silver Futures contract represents 5,000 troy ounces. At a spot price of $85.91, the math is staggering:</p>

<blockquote>
    5,000 t oz x $85.91 = <strong>$429,550 Notional Value</strong>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The Tick:</strong> The minimum move is $0.005. To find the value of a single "tick," we multiply the move by the contract size:</p>
<blockquote>
    $0.005 x 5,000 = $25.00 per tick
</blockquote>
<p>Because there are 200 ticks in a $1.00 move, silver moving just one dollar changes your account value by <strong>$5,000</strong>.</p>

<u>The SLV Alternative</u>
<p>For those avoiding the massive leverage of futures, the SLV ETF offers a smaller footprint. One SLV option contract controls 100 shares:</p>
<blockquote>
    $75.44 (Share Price) x 100 = <strong>$7,544 Notional Value</strong>
</blockquote>

<u>Gold: Futures (/GC) vs. GLD</u>
<p>One gold contract controls 100 troy ounces. With gold at $4,887.07, the notional value is <strong>$488,707</strong>. Traders often use roughly $27,000 in margin to control this, which is massive leverage.</p>

<u>The Gold-Silver Ratio (GSR)</u>
<p>Traders use this to see which metal is relatively "cheap."</p>
<blockquote>
    $4,887.07 (Gold) / $85.91 (Silver) = <strong>56.8</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>It currently takes about 57 ounces of silver to purchase 1 ounce of gold.</p>
